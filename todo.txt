Mitch,

What you are needing is for the resume correct..

Dr. Kotis,

- I do not want to sound like I am independent from him even though I am.  
- I came to him to bring enhancement of my many years of experience with all of the injectables that have significantly increased in the last few years.  
- To be able to provide these services while he is in surgery and not able to give the significant time and attention necessary.
- To broaden the aesthetic services that can be taken to an advanced level due to my combination of my Aesthetic Lisc and Nursing Lisc.
- I bring the advanced training in the various  Vampire procedures with emphasis on the Vampire Facial, Vampire Face Lift and the O Shot.
- I bring my 17 years in Dermatology to his practice to better educate and provide services in skin care.

- this Dr. never really has had a nurse, I am the first and I was brought on to do all the injectables because he is not good at it and does not have time to get good at it.
- It is the combination of his surgical skills and my skills that we hope to give the best of all worlds.

- I offer free consultations at his office and am acting as a consultant as well 

I am adding the services of 
Sclerotherapy
Kybella
Volbella
Vampire procedures
Chemical peels



Images Med Spa:
- at the Images I was hired only to do only injectables
- they want my Aesthetic experience to advise and consult but I am only a injector there...

- The Dr. who owns this place is not there and is a Dermatologist, he is in another office and does not really go there.

- I am the full time nurse there and was brought on to meet the needs of clients on a daily basis,  walk in for injectables and to consult as well as treat.

- They wanted me because I am an extension of the Dermatologist because of my Dermatology background.
